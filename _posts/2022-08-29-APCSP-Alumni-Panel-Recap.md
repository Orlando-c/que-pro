**APCSP Alumni Panel Recap**

  - > Names of panel: Colin, Anthony, Andrew, Mable, Allison, Ditya (Sorry if any names are butchered)

<!-- end list -->

  - > Colin likes to 3D model, is going to UCSD for mechanical engineering, took APCSP twice.

  - > Suggests you keep motivation, google your problems

<!-- end list -->

  - > Anthony majors in CS at UCI, took APCSP and APCSA, works at code ninjas.

  - > Suggests Google doc -\> DocX, refrain form clashing egos, focus on your path.

<!-- end list -->

  - > Andrew liked the complexity upon entering CS, He took CSA and Intro to CS. Going to UCSD or UCLA

  - > Suggests focusing on your work, the theory behind CS in high school is not the same entering college.

<!-- end list -->

  - > Mable found it hard to find motivation in CS but knew all the job opportunities it unlocked. She ended up in aerospace engineering and cognitive science

<!-- end list -->

  - > Allison was more artsy and business rather than geeky, she likes web building and is majoring cognitive science at UCLA

  - > Suggests that starting is the hardest part, there is the temptation to bs, dont cut corners

<!-- end list -->

  - > Ditya is a computer science major at UCLA, she likes to make games and applies APCSA for her real life problems

<!-- end list -->

  - > PBL Scenarios (Problem Based Learning)

Colin: There are a few hands on problems where you have to use your knowledge to solve the problem

Andrew: PBLâ€™s and Tests will be similar. PBL is involved in CS

Mable: Might be doing a lot of studying with groups. Large class sizes. Lot of time managing groups.

Takeaway: Computer Science does have some hands on learning and real life solving but more likely depends on which division you choose to take which will decide the amount of work you will be doing.

  - > How have you applied CS in your major if you are not majoring CS

Colin: Write scripts, make complex calculations

Mable: Trying to program analysis and stress test. You can use many different applications. Jupyter notebooks are used for technical math

Andrew: Math courses use a lot of code for applications like graphs, vertices, etc

Allison: Good for stats, phycology, etc

Takeaway: Computer Science is expanding the world around us and makes life a whole lot easier.

  - > For existing college students, have you had a job with a school or professor?

Colin: Stand out to your teachers - Internship with Northrop Grumman, wiring diagrams, visualizing flight data, cybersecurity

Anthony: Working at Code Ninjas

Mable: Internship at Northrop Grumman, Scripting for staff, flight data  
Andrew: Internship at LG (Javascript, html, python)

Takeaway: There are many professions and paths you can take towards building your career at a young age.

  - > Did you ever focus on personal projects?

Andrew: Focus on some personal projects. Very useful for applications

Anthony: Doesnt have to be much

Takeaway: Personal projects are good on resumes and show your knowledge.
