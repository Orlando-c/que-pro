<p><strong>Paragraph #1: Introduction</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Contextualization- 4 sentences with last sentence connecting to topic of essay. Must be within approx. 50 years of essay time period.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Thesis- explicit, makes an argument, answers all parts of prompt</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Paragraphs #2-3 (&amp; possibly 4): Body Paragraphs</strong> – Each paragraph must have</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Topic sentence</strong> with a clear argument (x, y, or z of thesis)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Summary, explanation, and HIPA sentences (ALL 7 documents must be used in your essay)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Summary</strong> <strong>sentences</strong> must begin with the name of the author or title of the document and end with the number of the document in parentheses. <em>Example: According to Alessandra Strozzi, Francesco di Messer Tanagli is willing to marry off his daughter to her exiled son, because she has a small dowry and he has a lot of children (Doc. 1).</em></p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>HIPA</strong> <strong>sentences</strong> must start with the <span class="underline">type of HIPA underlined</span> (see examples below).</p>
        </blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span class="underline">Historical Context</span></strong> - How is the document’s historical context relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt? Must include a specific event before the document was created and an explanation about how the event supports your argument. <em>Example: The <span class="underline">historical context</span> of the letter is during the Renaissance parents often arranged marriages for their children to increase the power and wealth of their family, which is exactly what Strozzi is trying to do by arranging a marriage between her son and the daughter of Francesco di Messer Tanagli.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
          </li>
          <li>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span class="underline">Intended Audience/Purpose</span></strong> (MUST BE COMPLETED TOGETHER) - How are the document’s purpose and audience relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt? Must include an action that the author wants a specific group of people to do. Caution! Just using the verbs “tell”, “show, or “inform” is not enough to capture the action the author wants the audience to take. <em>Example: The <span class="underline">intended audience</span> of the letter is Strozzi’s son with the <span class="underline">purpose</span> of encouraging him to accept the marriage she has arranged with Tanagli.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
          </li>
          <li>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span class="underline">Author’s Point of View</span></strong> - How is the document’s author’s pov relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt? Must include an aspect of the author’s identity (gender, race/ethnicity, class, profession, nationality, religion and an explanation about how that characteristic supports your argument. <em>Example: The <span class="underline">author’s point of view</span> is Strozzi is a mother who wants her son to marry a wife who will advance his position in society and therefore increase the position of the whole family.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Outside evidence</strong> (2 pieces of outside evidence per essay)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Outside evidence must be at least 2 sentences and the last sentence must end with “outside evidence” in parentheses.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>Example: Royal women were expected to marry whomever their families chose in order to form alliances and increase their country’s power. Isabelle and Ferdinand of Spain married their daughter Catherine of Aragon to Henry VIII, king of England, in order to form an alliance between their two countries and therefore increase the power of Spain (Outside Evidence).</em></p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Last Paragraph: Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Rewrite thesis to reflect the arguments of your essay* (if you have time)</em></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Additional Contextualization* (if you have time)</em></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span class="underline">College Board DBQ Rubric</span></strong> (7 pts)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Thesis/Claim (1 pt) - Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning. CANNOT merely restate or rephrase the prompt. May be multiple sentences.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Contextualization (1 pt) - Describes broader historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the question. Must be more than a mere phrase or reference.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Evidence (2 pts) -</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>1 pt.</strong> Uses the content of at least three documents to address the topic of the prompt. Simple quotes of the documents will NOT earn credit.</p>

  <p><strong>2 pts.</strong> Supports an argument in response to the prompt using at least six documents. Simple quotes of the documents will NOT earn credit.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Reasoning &amp; Analysis (2 pts) -</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>1 pt.</strong> For at least three documents, explains how or why the document’s historical context, intended audience, purpose, or author’s point of view is relevant to an argument.</p>

  <p><strong>2 pts.</strong> Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify or modify an argument that addresses the question. This understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.</p>
