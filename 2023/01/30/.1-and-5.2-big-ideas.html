<li>Personal input<ul>
<li>I believe that the result of being happy can't come from a place full of nagativity and hate (aka social media). Most and if not all social medias are built arount the sole concept of being better or feeling better than other people on the platform. Likes and follows may play a contributing factor but it's more about how this affects your personal body image and mental health. I get tired and bored everyday looking at my cell phone, not getting work done, and going to sleep at midnight knowing that I stayed up so late because of my phone. I use TikTok, Instagram, and Youtube as primary sources of consuming media, infinite possibilities, but I never feel as happy as when I look to the stars at night and wonder if we can ever reach there, as when I come home from a long day of schoo; and think to myself, is it all worth it and realizing it will be, as when I hang out with friends that will lead me the right path and are the greatest friends I could ever have and will have. That is the real issue with social media, a drain of content that consumes you with it, turning you into a mindless consumer, stuck in media limbo. If my future self or anyone is reading this, when you go home, take a walk or lay in your bed, close your eyes, and think to yourself, just you and your thoughts.</li>

<ul>
<li>While phones have proven to become necessary in todays society, they have also become a major risk in the health and danger aspect of things. Nearly 15% of car crashes involve someone who was texting or using hands off car technology to manage their phone which is still incredibly distractiong. Phones also have an effect on mental health such as the mind warping reality of social media and access to the entire internet may lead to some unprecidented results. Phones are also gatekeeped, meaning the more capible phones with better technology costs practically 33% of todays average paycheck. Many dont have access to cellular data or phones at all which leads to our next discussion.</li>

<h1 id="5.2">5.2<a class="anchor-link" href="#5.2"> </a></h1><h3 id="How-can-I-empower-myself-in-a-digital-world?">How can I empower myself in a digital world?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-can-I-empower-myself-in-a-digital-world?"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>Someone may empower themselves in a digital world by maintaning a balance between life and technology as well as speaking out about others who may be harassing or being harassed. At Del Norte I could involve myself more into other activities to take my mind off the negativity of society.
### How can I help others empower themselves?</li>
<li>Many people today encourage others to speak out and let us help them in a time and society where many may need help. A lot of mentall illness, depression, or other life atering events may occur due to those who are suffering silently and a good way to reach out to them or for them to speak out is through social media or means of messaging them.
### Gatekeeping of technology</li>
<li>I do believe that technology is being gatekeeped by large corporations such as Google and Apple however is not a problem at Del Norte because our school provides resources for many who may be in financial struggle or are in need of the technology. Unfortunately, other school districts dont have acess to many resources and this creates a divide in our communitites and society.
### Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?</li>
<li>I am a advocate on the removal of some, if not all restrctions on the school wifi. There have been many moments where a resource for AP world history or spanish class amy be blocked due to the districhs internet blocker. Our school invades our private property as well, installing the same internet protection services on your PERSONAL COMPUTER. Even being signed in onto your laptop with your chool account allows them to see your search history, downloaded or uploaded files on your internet provider, and is generally a massive invasion of privacy. The only good thing I can see coming from the internet blocker is so students dont end up searching lewd things on the internet at school or home which is rendered useless due to many being able to do the same thing on their phone (that is bad dont do this just used this as an example).
### What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide?</li>
<li>My concern is that without the right resources, the digital divide between communities and societies will become much larger. The average IQ of a person in an area where they have access to a wider and better variety of learning resouces will be higher than that of a person who does not have a laptop nor phone. I believe that we should provide to thse who are unable to provide resources for the future generation whom are supposed to better the world.</li>
